A set of python scripts for automatic editing of WordPress pages

/ardupilot_heartbeat - simple heartbeat scripts that will restart apache and varnish if they go down. Run every minute. 
NOTE - if you DELIBERATELY STOP APACHE, this will restart it. So we need to remember to turn it off if working with apache.
This is located in /home/ubuntu/ardupilot_heartbeat/ along with its log. This is owned and run by the root chrontab.
